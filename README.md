# Hi 👋 My name is Francisco Alvarado


Fullstack Web Developer
---------------------------------------

 A pipe welder who has discovered a whole new world within the intricate lines of code. During my downtime, I found a hidden passion for software development. Wwhat started as a curiosity has evolved into a full-fledged journey of self-discovery and skill-building. I've been fervently teaching myself how to code, exploring languages like JavaScript, HTML/CSS, and more. Recognizing the potential of this newfound interest, I've recently embarked on an exciting adventure by enrolling in a Software Engineering Bootcamp.
